# Atmospheric/CD calculations for infalatable nanosatellite

Current code used to gather data for designing inflatable cubesat. Gathers data and compares a spherical satellite to an inflatable one. Displays certain datapoints based on what is required. Can easily be changed to display different data and comparisons.

## Getting Started

Simply download matlab, install all files and run.

### Prerequisites

matlab

## IMPORTANT DETAILS
currently the code works to reduce run time after the initial run, creates files to be read opposed to altering calculations each time while still reading a file. This sacrifices space and thus files should be deleted after use. Such files will currently be located in CUBEMODELS folder, any files with a suffix of numbers can be deleted
